## Statistical Analysis

\subsection*{Calculation of Ash-Free Dry Weight (AFDW):}

The AFDW was determined using the following equation:

\[
AFDW = DW \times \left(1 - \frac{{\text{Ash Content}}}{{100}}\right)
\]

\begin{itemize}
    \item \( AFDW \): Ash-free dry weight.
    \item \( DW \): Dry weight of the sample.
    \item \text{Ash Content}: Percentage of ash content in the sample.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Conversion of Oxygen Consumption to Energy Expenditure:}

<<<<<<< HEAD
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cellular respiration involves the consumption of oxygen (O2) through a process of organismal respiration to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) \cite{babcock1992oxygen} according to the equation: 

\[
C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{energy (as ATP)}
\]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To calculate respiration, we first multiplied the moles of oxygen consumed per hour by the molar mass of oxygen, which is approximately \(32 \, \text{g/mol}\) \citep{hochachka1983protons}, to convert from moles of oxygen to grams of oxygen. Then we used an oxy-joulometric conversion factor derived from \cite{elliott1975energy}, which is \(14.14 \, \text{J/mg O}_2\), to convert from grams of oxygen consumed per hour to joules of energy expended during cellular respiration.

The calculation can be expressed as follows:

\[
\text{Energy expenditure (J)} = \text{grams of O}_2 \times \text{conversion factor}
\]

To convert moles of oxygen to grams, we used the molar mass of oxygen:

\[
\text{grams of O}_2 = \text{moles of O}_2 \times 32 \, \text{g/mol}
\]

Substituting the values, we get:

\[
\text{Energy expenditure (J)} = \text{grams of O}_2 \times 14140 \, \text{J/g O}_2
\]

where \(32 \, \text{g/mol}\) is the molar mass of oxygen and \(14140 \, \text{J/g O}_2\) is the conversion factor derived from \cite{elliott1975energy} and expressed as  \(14.140 \, \text{J/mg O}_2\) before conversion.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After converting the oxygen consumption rates to energy expenditure in joules per hour per snail and performing statistical analysis, we conducted a two-way ANOVA to investigate the effects of temperature treatment and pH treatment on energy expenditure. The ANOVA revealed a significant effect of temperature treatment (\(p < 0.001\)), indicating that different temperature treatments had a significant impact on energy expenditure. Although the pH treatment showed some effect on energy expenditure, it was marginally significant (F(1, 44) = 3.9760, p = 0.05237), suggesting a potential influence of pH on energy expenditure. The interaction between temperature and pH treatment was not significant (F(7, 44) = 1.5286, p = 0.18280), indicating that the combined effect of temperature and pH treatment did not significantly impact energy expenditure beyond the individual effects of each factor.  Subsequent Tukey multiple comparisons showed significant differences between most temperature treatment pairs. For example, the energy expenditure at 14°C was significantly higher than at 12°C (mean difference = 13.31 J/h, p < 0.001), and the energy expenditure at 22°C was significantly higher than at 20°C (mean difference = 60.21 J/h, p < 0.001). Tukey multiple comparison indicated a significant difference between low and ambient pH conditions, with a higher energy expenditure observed under low pH (mean difference = 5.95 J/h, p < 0.001).

\subsection*{Thermal Performance Curve Analysis:}

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All statistical analyses were run in the R environment \citep{R_core_team_2021}. The \textit{rTPC} \citep{padfield2021rtpc} and \textit{nls.multstart} packages were used to fit a series of models to the respiration rate data and build thermal performance curves. The analysis utilized the \textit{rtpc} package in R, which enables a pipeline to fit data to multiple models simultaneously. Thermal performance curves (TPC) were analyzed to investigate the relationship between temperature and performance measure (e.g., metabolic rate) of \textit{T. funebralis}. The statistical processing of the thermal performance curves involved analyzing the data collected from the respiration chambers and examining statistical graphs of oxygen evolution over time. Regression analysis was employed to explore the relationship between temperature and oxygen evolution and to estimate the parameters of the thermal performance curve (e.g., slope). Specifically, we have utilized techniques such as nonlinear regression to fit thermal performance models to the data and assess the goodness of fit. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During the regression analysis, it was crucial to examine the distribution of model parameters this involved assessing the normality of the distribution of $\beta$ values and investigating potential outliers or unusual patterns.Additionally, we inspected the distribution of residuals, which are the differences between observed and predicted values, to ensure they were normally distributed and exhibited homoscedasticity. Additionally, diagnostic plots, specifically quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots, were employed to assess the normality of residuals and identify any potential outliers or systematic patterns embedded within the data. We examined the relationship between predictor variables (e.g., temperature) and fitted values to ensure the model adequately captured the underlying trends in the data. Moreover, we inspected the standard residuals, to identify observations with unusually large or small residuals. Any outlying observations that indicated data errors, measurement inaccuracies, or other anomalies that necessitated further investigation were subsequently excluded from the analysis.

\subsection*{Model Fit and Selection:}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The thermal performance curve (TPC) model was fitted to the data using nonlinear regression techniques in R, specifically the \texttt{nls\_multistart()} function. Model fit was assessed with the coefficient of determination ($R^2$), indicating a strong fit to the observed data. The model selection process involved fitting several models for ectotherm physiology (e.g., Gaussian, Sharpe-Schoolfield) using Akaike Information Criterion corrected for small sample sizes (AICc). The Sharpe-Schoolfield model was chosen as the preferred model for this study due to its goodness of fit, and its physiological relevance to ectotherms  based on enzyme kinetics. This model is widely used in ecological and physiological studies to understand how organisms respond to changing environmental temperatures, particularly in the context of climate change and thermal stress.Additionally, bootstrap resampling methods were employed to assess parameter uncertainty and validate the uncertainty of the data following  \cite{Olito2017estimating}.

\textbf{Sharpe-Schoolfield High Model Equation:}
\begin{equation}
R(T) = \frac{R_{\text{ref}}}{1 + e^{\left(\frac{E}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{ref}}}\right)\right) + e_h\left(\frac{1}{T} - \frac{1}{T_{\text{opt}}}\right)}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Description of Variables:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \( R(T) \): Rate of the biological process at temperature \( T \).
    \item \( R_{\text{ref}} \): Rate at the standardised temperature, \( T_{\text{ref}} \).
    \item \( E \): Activation energy (eV).
    \item \( k \): Boltzmann's constant (\( 8.617333262145 \times 10^{-5} \) eV/K).
    \item \( T \): Temperature (°C).
    \item \( T_{\text{ref}} \): Standardisation temperature (°C). Temperature at which rates are not inactivated by either high or low temperatures.
    \item \( e_h \): High temperature deactivation energy (eV).
    \item \( T_{\text{opt}} \): Temperature (°C) at which enzyme is 1/2 active and 1/2 suppressed due to high temperatures.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Additional Information:}
The Sharpe-Schoolfield high model describes the temperature dependence of biological rates, such as metabolic rates, enzyme activities, or reaction rates, in response to high temperatures. It incorporates parameters such as activation energy, high temperature deactivation energy, and optimum temperature to characterize the thermal performance curve \cite{sharpe1981non}. The results of the thermal performance curve analysis provide insights into the organism's temperature-dependent performance and its thermal ecology. The optimum temperature (Topt) indicates the temperature range in which the organism performs optimally, while the thermal limits (CTmin and CTmax) define the species' thermal tolerance. The thermal sensitivity or breadth parameter (b) reflects the organism's ability to acclimate or adapt to temperature changes and its vulnerability to thermal stress.
