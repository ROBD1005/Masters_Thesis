#INTRODUCTION
\end{centering}

  Organisms and environments are entwined, as the relationship between organisms and the environments they are embedded within, is in constant flux through inextricable links and flows of energy. The relationship between organisms and environments varies through both space and time and is influenced by a mosaic of dynamic biotic and abiotic drivers (Connell, 1977; Menge & Sutherland, 1987). Organisms are active participants in constructing their environment, from altering seawater biogeochemistry through physiological processes to organisms constructing biogenic structures; plenty of studies demonstrate that organisms influence their environment (Lewontin, 1983; Estes & Palmisano, 1974; Silbiger et al., 2018). Organisms and ecosystems, while playing an essential role in structuring the physical and biological environment, are simultaneously governed by the ability to perform and function under a myriad of complex interactions, as each act to influence one another non- contemporaneously and contemporaneously through direct and indirect feedback loops (Levin & Paine, 1974; Paine, 1981). Organisms must physiologically cope with the conditions of the environment they are situated within, which inevitably influences community structure and populations (Bozinovic & Pörtner, 2015). Further, the biogenic structures created by organisms are highly dependent upon the environmental regime the organism develops in, living beyond the life of the organism itself; organisms are thus simultaneously creators and products of the environment. In a geological epoch of rapid ecological change, it is increasingly imperative to understand how and the extent to which organisms can respond and perform to abiotic drivers and how the legacy of the structures (e.g., shells, reefs) that organisms create may influence other species indirectly. Understanding physiological responses, interactions, and constraints of marine organisms to anthropogenic climate change is perhaps the sine qua non for understanding the changes between marine organisms and the ecosystems they construct. This research intends to inform how the changing oceanic environment may affect organismal physiology by teasing apart the relationship between environmental drivers and physiological performance. This research also intends to elucidate how changes within physiological processes in one organism may have indirect effects on other species long after the organism persists. In this regard, the fate of organisms is intertwined as the abundance and growth of one species codetermines the other, illustrating that organisms are directly or indirectly the subjects and objects of ecological change (Lewontin, 1983).

#ORGANISMS AS THE OBJECTS OF ECOLOGICAL CHANGE
\end{centering}

  Environments are governed by natural spatiotemporal variation of abiotic and biotic drivers that, in turn, influence the structure and processes of communities, drive ecological change, and create a mosaic of microhabitats (Connell, 1961; Stenseth et al., 2002; Kroeker et al., 2017). For example, within marine ecosystems, the combination of oceanographic processes and local coastal geography may create an array of patterns and variability in abiotic drivers such as temperature, flow, pH, dissolved oxygen, etc., that may impact the structure and processes of ecological communities on distances ranging from microscale to macroscale (Deser, et al., 2010; Hoffman et al., 2010). Such heterogeneous patterns are naturally occurring and create complex gradients that shape ecological communities and influence physiological processes within individual organisms (Helmuth et al., 2006). However, due to the connotation of stress as a negative response and the ability for organisms to adapt and evolve to changing conditions over time, the term driver has been utilized to describe an environmental parameter that influences organisms and environments across a spectrum ranging from enhancing, optimal, or stressful conditions (Côté et al., 2016; Boyd and Hutchins, 2012). Many organisms have evolved to withstand complex and variable environmental gradients through physiological mechanisms such as phenotypic plasticity and acclimatization (Hoffman & Togham, 2010; Tomanek, 2002). According to the metabolic theory of ecology, environmental gradients and changes in abiotic factors may result in physiological trade-offs due to the alterations within the energetic partitioning of an organism's metabolism (Pörtner, 2008; Brown et al., 2004). The physiological processes of metabolism are the total sum of biological and chemical processes in converting energetic resources and materials into biomass and activity (Brown et al., 2004). Comparing physiological responses to gradients of abiotic drivers may allow us to quantify and compare the tolerance limits of organisms (Somero, 2002; Silbiger et al., 2019). The role of biotic and abiotic drivers in influencing metabolic processes has been of primary interest to the field of ecology as changes in metabolism directly affect the survival, behavior, and energy requirements of organisms, thereby impacting fitness and ecosystem function (Carey, Harianto, & Byrne, 2016).


  Temperature and pH are important for determining physiological processes and metabolic rates for marine organisms and thereby play a large role in affecting the functioning and physiology of ecosystems (Woodwell, 1970). Temperature is the key driver in determining physiological rates of organisms as the kinetic energy of biochemical reactions is temperature dependent (Levins, 1968; Somero 2002, Pörtner, 2012). Biological processes such as organismal and ecological interactions are also strongly influenced by temperature (Hochachka and Somero, 2002). The relationship between temperature and body-size exemplifies this as organisms develop faster yet decrease in size under elevated temperatures (Elahi, 2020). Metabolic rates are strongly influenced by an organism's body size and temperature and are subject to change due tochanges in abiotic drivers and the natural variability of drivers (Brown et al., 2004; O'Connor, 2007). Further, organisms adapt to local temperatures to match optimal conditions for physiological processes and acclimatize to a range around these values (Sinclair et al., 2016). Any range too far beyond the ability of an organism to acclimatize influences survival, fitness, and population densities (Hochachka and Somero, 2002). Studies have shown the influence of sea surface temperature on metabolic processes such as growth, feeding, reproduction, and influencing the range of species distributions (Kordas et al., 2011; Sanford, 2002; Pinsky et al., 2013). However, it is essential to note that temperature is not the only driver of biological processes and temperature has interactive effects with other abiotic drivers (Darling and Côté 2008). pH is also an important abiotic driver that impacts the physiological performance of marine organisms and influences the biogenic structures that organisms create (Hoffman and Togham, 2010). pH plays a vital role in metabolic processes due to its effect on biochemical pathways and internal acid-base balance (Gaylord et al., 2015). For example, low pH is often associated with elevated metabolic rates due to the increase in energetic costs in creating calcified structures such as the formation of shells in mollusks or the skeletons of corals and echinoderms (Doney et al., 2009; Spalding et al., 2017). Due to differences in the energetic costs associated with calcification, there are significant differences in the ability to control acid-base regulation between species (Doney et al., 2009). Consequently, changes in physicochemical parameters of the environment affect species differently, impact the interaction between species and, in turn, affect the structures of ecological communities; therefore, studying how differences between abiotic drivers affect organismal physiology will have ecosystem-level implications (Tomanek & Helmuth, 2002; Gaylord 2019).

#ORGANISMAL PHYSIOLOGY IN A CHANGING ENVIRONMENT
\end{centering}

  Anthropogenic induced changes to the carbon cycle, as a result of increasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, are influencing seawater temperature and the acidity of the ocean (decrease in pH) from the dissolution of CO2 altering seawater carbonate chemistry. Since the beginning of the 20th century, marine ecosystems have experienced an average sea surface temperature increase of 1.5° C which is expected to rise by 1–4 °C by the end of the 21st century (IPCC, 2022). The highly variable mosaic of temperature regimes will influence the ability for organisms to respond and adapt to future temperature changes due to the influence of environmental history on organismal responses to stress (Safaie, et al. 2018). However, these projected scenarios will surpass the thermal tolerance limit of many marine species (Bay et al., 2017; Somnero, 2010). Further, the ocean has absorbed nearly 30% of anthropogenic CO2 (Sabine et al., 2004), declining the global average pH by 0.1 units, and is expected to decrease average pH by another 0.3-0.4 units by the end of the century (Caldeira & Wickett, 2003). It is imperative to note that future changes in pH, much like temperature, will be highly variable and differ based on local oceanographic phenomena and conditions, for example, the intensification of upwelling in certain regions (Garcia-Reyes & Largier, 2012; Bakun, 1990). The expected future changes in seawater carbonate physicochemical parameters will impact marine organisms by altering the range and variability of pH and temperature that organisms experience (Bakun, 1990; IPCC, 2022). Further, studies have shown that changes in pH will have profound effects on the ability of calcifying organisms to produce their skeletons and shells due to an increase in the energy required to maintain calcified structures in acidified seawater (Kroeker et al., 2010; Gaylord et al., 2015). Calcified structures may be constructed weaker, or calcification may be maintained at the expense of other metabolic processes (Gaylord, et al. 2015). These structures, which are products of the environmental history that they were produced in, outlive the organisms that create them and influence other species, such as the gastropod constructed shells that hermit crabs inhabit or the structural complexity that corals create through the accretion of calcium carbonate in skeleton construction (Laidre, 2011; Graham and Nash, 2013). Consequently, ocean acidification and warming, as drivers of ecological change attributed to climate change, co-occur and should be studied together due to potentially interactive effects within and between species.

  Organisms are adapted to cope with a natural range of abiotic conditions, yet anthropogenic climate change may outpace organismal physiological capacities and may also act interactively to result in “ecological surprises'' (sense, Paine et al., 1969). For example, the cumulative impact of two drivers acting together may interact to be equivalent to their sum, known as an additive effect, less than their additive effect, which is known as an antagonistic interaction, or greater than their additive effect, known as a synergistic interaction (Côté et al., 2016). For decades anti-racist and feminist scholars have provided critical insight into the ways in we must think about isolated phenomena as intersectional due to their complex interactions (Davis, 1983; Crenshaw, 1989). The field of marine biology requires this paradigm shift that embraces the interactions between stressors to grasp the complexity of the future. Combined, these drastic changes in abiotic drivers will continue to act in conjecture with one another and could potentially ameliorate or exacerbate impacts on organismal physiological processes and reverberate the effects of ecological change through ecosystems (Kroeker, Kordas, & Harley, 2017).
  
  Despite the increasing emphasis on multi-driver and multi-species studies, a mechanistic understanding of the nonlinear responses of multiple confounding stressors of future scenarios remains a knowledge gap. (Kroeker, Kordas, & Harley, 2017). The elevated sense of urgency involved with these global threats contributes to the need for a more nuanced understanding of the impact of multiple stressor interactions on organismal and ecosystem processes (Côté et al., 2016). The response of organisms to climate change, survival, and fitness depends on physiological trade-offs, which are essentially changed within the allocation of an organism's energy for different biological functions and demands for resources. Considering that metabolic processes respond differently to multiple environmental drivers and that physiological systems within and between organisms differ, it is imperative to tease apart the metabolic rates. Organisms may respond to changing abiotic drivers by altering their energetic allocation or energetic intake, such as altering consumption rates or growth (O’Connor 2009). For example, the metabolic theory of ecology predicts an increase in consumption rates with increasing temperature (O’Connor 2009). These alterations within an individual species’ physiological performance are significant because they can scale up to affect ecosystem function (Post et al., 1999). Building a mechanistic understanding regarding how the combined impacts of ocean warming and acidification affect marine organisms is integral for reliable projections of how climate change may continue to affect marine organisms.
